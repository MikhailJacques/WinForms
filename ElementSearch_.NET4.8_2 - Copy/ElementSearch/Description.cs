//The given code defines a Windows Forms application within the "ElementSearch" namespace that searches and
//displays elements in a hierarchical tree structure based on their element type, channel, and database.
//The main class, "ElementSearch", is a subclass of the "Form" class.

//The application reads data from four text files containing element types, channels, databases, and element data.
//These text files are read, tokenized, and used to create dictionaries and TreeView structures to display the data in a hierarchical manner.

//Three TreeView structures are used to represent element types, channels, and databases.When nodes in these TreeViews are checked or unchecked,
//the corresponding elements are added or removed from a ListView structure.The ListView displays the following information about each element:

//ID
//LongName
//ShortName
//ElementType
//Channel
//Database
//Location
//Handle
//Additionally, there's a "Clear" button which, when clicked, clears the text boxes,
//unchecks and collapses all nodes in the TreeView structures, and clears the ListView.

//This C# code defines a Windows Forms application called ElementSearch. The application reads data from four text files and displays it in TreeViews and a ListView.

//The ElementSearch class contains a constructor that initializes the form, loads the data, and adds TreeView event handlers.
//The LoadData method reads the data from text files, and the FillTreeView method populates the TreeViews.
//The AddNode method is used to add nodes to the TreeViews, and the UpdateChildNodesCheckedState method updates the checked state of child nodes.

//The AddTreeViewEventHandlers method sets up event handlers for the AfterCheck event of each TreeView.
//The UpdateListViewForNodeHierarchy method adds or removes items from the ListView based on the checked state of the TreeView nodes.
//The AddElementToListView and RemoveElementFromListView methods are used to add or remove items from the ListView.

//The TextBoxElementName_KeyDown method is an event handler for searching in the ListView based on the text input.
//The buttonClear_Click method clears the TreeViews and the ListView when the "Clear" button is clicked.
//The buttonSend_Click method is currently empty and marked for later implementation.

//The TextBoxElementType_KeyDown, TextBoxChannel_KeyDown, and TextBoxDatabase_KeyDown methods are event handlers for searching and
//checking nodes in the corresponding TreeViews based on the text input. The SearchAndCheckNode method is used to search and check nodes in the TreeViews.

//Overall, the application's purpose is to display, search, and filter data from text files using TreeViews and a ListView.
//The code appears to be well-structured, and the methods are organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the flow and functionality of the application.
