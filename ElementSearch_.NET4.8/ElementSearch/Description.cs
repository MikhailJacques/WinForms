//This code appears to be a C# Windows Forms application that allows users to search and display elements from a set of input text files.
//The application provides an interface with three TreeViews for element types, channels, and databases,
//as well as a ListView to display the search results.

// High-level summary of the code:

//The application uses the ElementSearch namespace and includes several using statements for required dependencies.
//The FormElementSearch class is derived from the Form class, and it contains several private fields for storing dictionaries and element data.
//The constructor initializes the form components.
//The FormElementSearch_Load event handler loads data from text files located in the project's data directory and
//populates the TreeViews with their respective data.
//The FillDictionaries method processes the data from the text files to populate the dictionaries for element types, channels, and databases.
//The ReadTextFile method reads the text files and tokenizes each line.
//The FillTreeView method asynchronously populates the TreeViews with their respective data.
//The AddNode method recursively adds nodes to the TreeView.
//The UpdateChildNodes and UpdateParentNode methods update the checked state of child and parent nodes, respectively.
//The treeViewElemType_AfterCheck, treeViewChannel_AfterCheck,
//and treeViewDatabase_AfterCheck event handlers update the ListView when a node's checked state changes in any of the TreeViews.
//The HandleTreeViewAfterCheck method handles the TreeView AfterCheck event, updating child and parent nodes' checked states.
//The GetCheckedNodes method retrieves all checked nodes from the TreeView.
//The UpdateListView method updates the ListView with search results based on the checked nodes in the TreeViews.
//The FindAndCheckNode method finds and checks a node in the TreeView based on the given name.
//The FindNodeByName method recursively searches for a TreeNode by name.
//The buttonSearch_Click event handler searches for the specified element type, channel, and database and updates the ListView with the results.
//The buttonClear_Click event handler clears the textboxes and TreeViews and resets the ListView.
//The ClearTreeView method clears the checked state and collapses nodes in the TreeView.
//The UncheckAndCollapseNodes method recursively unchecks and collapses TreeNodes.
//When the application is executed, it reads data from the specified text files, populates the TreeViews, and allows the user to search for
//specific element types, channels, and databases. The search results are then displayed in the ListView.
//The user can clear the search input and reset the TreeViews using the "Clear" button.


//It takes three lists of checked nodes (checkedElemTypeNodes, checkedChannelNodes, and checkedDatabaseNodes) and concatenates them into a single sequence. This means that all the elements from these three lists are combined into a single list.
//For each node in the concatenated list, it extracts the Tag property and tries to cast it as an object of type MyTreeNode. The Tag property is used to store custom data associated with each node.
//It filters out any nodes that were not successfully cast to MyTreeNode objects or are null. This ensures that the resulting sequence only contains valid MyTreeNode objects.
//It groups the valid MyTreeNode objects by their _ID property. This creates groups of nodes that share the same _ID.
//It creates a dictionary from the grouped nodes. The key of the dictionary is the _ID property, and the value is the _Handle property of the first node in each group. If the first node in the group has a null _Handle, the value will be set to 0.
//In summary, this code snippet combines nodes from three lists, filters them, groups them by their _ID property, and creates a dictionary with the _ID as the key and the _Handle of the first node in each group as the value.
//var allCheckedNodes = checkedElemTypeNodes.Concat(checkedChannelNodes).Concat(checkedDatabaseNodes)
//    .Select(node => node.Tag as MyTreeNode)
//    .Where(node => node != null)
//    .GroupBy(node => node!._ID)
//    .ToDictionary(g => g.Key, g => g.First()?._Handle ?? 0);
