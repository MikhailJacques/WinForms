Instead of the 'List<String^>^ hierarchy' parameter I need the 'List<MyTreeNode^>^' hierarchy parameter, where the MyTreeNode object has two additional data members, namely ID and Handle, which are unique to each node. They must be added in code accordingly.
For example, given the following hierarchy, which is read from a text file (no need to implement it):

 grandparent1@1@1
 grandparent1/parent1@2@2
 grandparent1/parent1 / child3@3@3
 grandparent2@4@4
 grandparent2/parent1@5@5
 grandparent2/parent1/child1@6@6
 grandparent2/parent1/child2@7@7
 grandgrandparent3@8@8
 grandgrandparent3/grandparent1@9@9
 grandgrandparent3/grandparent1/parent1@10@10
 grandgrandparent3/grandparent1/parent1/child1@11@11
 
 where the text represents node's name and it is respective location in the hierarchy followed by its ID and handle numerical values separated by @ 
 I need to have the following representation in the TreeView control:
 
 grandparent1, 1, 1
 - parent1, 2, 2
   - child3, 3, 3
 grandparent2, 4, 4
 - parent1, 5, 5
   - child1, 6, 6
   - child2, 7, 7
 grandgrandparent3, 8, 8
 - grandparent1, 9, 9
   - parent1, 10, 10
     - child1, 11, 11
 
 where the ID and Handle numerical values must be part of the MyTreeNode object for later retrieval. 
 The ID and Handle need not be displayed and are shown for the sake of the example.

 Can you please provide an implementation for this?
